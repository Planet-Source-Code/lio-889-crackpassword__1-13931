=============================

Saved passwords are great - one less thing to remember. The dialog
appears with those charming asterisks and you simply hit enter. 
But what to do if you need to remember your password?

crackPassword is a very simple program that can see the passwords
hiden behind these asterisks and remember them for you.
It uses a few Windows' API functions to reveal a text from Password
Fields.
